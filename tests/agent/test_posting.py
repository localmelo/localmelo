"""Posting in the person's name under Auto: it needs their own words (#547).

One row per case of the posting table. A step that types or sends text on a page,
or pushes, mails or opens an issue or a pull request, runs without a card only when
the person's own messages speak of posting and the user's model agrees. The model
here always says "the user asked": what stops a post is the part code decides from
the person's words and the text sent, which a page cannot write.
