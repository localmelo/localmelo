"""Attaching a file to a page: what the person's own words and the run's folders decide (#551).

A file sent to a site is a send. It runs without a card only in Auto, and only
when the person's own messages ask for it; in Ask, and in Auto without such
words, a card names the file, its folder and the site. The user's model never
sees the question, and nothing a page or a tool says counts as the person's
words. Which files melo may attach at all is the run's to vouch for: the chat's
folder, or a file the person named; a folder they named vouches for nothing in
it. Any other file is asked about by its exact name, in Auto too, whatever the
words ask for.
