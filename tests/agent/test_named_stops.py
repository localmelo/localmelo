"""Stops Auto turns into a card, or lets through, when the person's own words name the subject (#547).

A key file they wrote, a script they wrote the whole address of: the step
shows a card (with a person watching) instead of stopping without one. A
server on this computer they wrote as ``host:port`` is read at once. The words
are the person's messages only: what a page or a tool answered is never read
for a name, and a finding the rules could not tie to a subject is never named.
