"""Read a PDF: its text page by page, and a picture of each page that has none.

``file_read`` and ``web_fetch`` both read a PDF through this module, so a PDF
means the same in either. A file or a download is a PDF by its first bytes
(:data:`MAGIC`), whatever its name or type says.

The bytes go to a child process (:mod:`._pdf_child`) on its standard input,
and nothing else goes with them: the library that parses them is not
thread-safe, and a crash of it must end the child, not the gateway. The child
is a fresh interpreter started by path (``python -I``), so melo's own modules
are not loaded into it and pypdfium2 is imported only there. It runs in a group
of its own, and ends by itself: after :data:`TIMEOUT_S` plus a few seconds of
CPU or of wall clock, whichever comes first, so it is bounded even if this
process is gone. While it runs this process watches it, and kills the group
whole on the wall clock (:data:`TIMEOUT_S`), a cancellation, an answer over its
limit, or a resident memory over :data:`MAX_RSS_BYTES`. That last limit is a
sample, not a sandbox: it looks every :data:`WATCH_S`, so a burst between two
looks can pass it unseen; it stops ordinary runaway memory only. When the
memory cannot be read :data:`BLIND_LOOKS` looks in a row while the child still
runs, the child is stopped too. One read runs at a time in a process, so the
limit holds for all of them together. A file over :data:`MAX_BYTES` is never
sent. Of the pages, :data:`MAX_PAGES` are read, and of the text,
:data:`MAX_CHARS` characters (a page's text is whole in the child before that
limit cuts it). Nothing leaves the child but one JSON object, and the child is
not trusted: its answer is read up to a limit that depends on what was asked,
and checked (types, counts, sizes, every byte of a picture's PNG structure)
before any of it is used. What goes wrong reaches the model as one plain line
(:class:`PdfError`), never a traceback.

The text of a page under :data:`NO_TEXT_CHARS` characters is a page with no
text (a scan, a drawing): its text stays empty, a line says so, and
:func:`with_pictures` sends a picture of it, as many as one result carries
(:data:`MAX_PICTURES`). A picture is a PNG no larger than a screenshot (the
width :data:`PICTURE_WIDTH` the agent scales tool pictures to). An empty page
never reads as an empty document: its line is there whether or not its picture
reaches the model.
